Platformer Demo Game
====================

This is a self-contained HTML5 platformer demo inspired by classic platformers.
It uses the character image provided (assets/char_6.png) and includes many requested features:
- Full health system (HP bars)
- Multiple enemies with variety: grunt, ranged, flyers, bosses
- Enemy AI: patrol, chase, ranged attacks, flyers
- Combo attacks (punch -> kick -> special)
- Special move animation (area effect)
- Background tiles/tiles-like ground rendering
- Coins, powerups, items (collect and use / shop)
- Local multiplayer (two local players on one keyboard)
- Particle effects for hits and explosions
- Map scrolling and multi-level layout (long level)
- Inventory & simple shop system
- Downloadable ZIP package (this archive)

How to run:
1. Unzip the package and open index.html in a modern browser.
2. Controls:
   - Player 1: ArrowLeft / ArrowRight to move, ArrowUp to jump, "m" to attack, "." for special
   - Player 2: A / D to move, W to jump, "f" to attack, "e" for special
3. Open Shop button opens shop UI.

Notes:
- This demo intentionally avoids using copyrighted assets from any commercial game.
- Online multiplayer isn't fully implemented here (requires a server). Local multiplayer works.
- The game is a compact demo to demonstrate requested systems — you can extend it further.
